# Email Bin

Because collecting emails should be easy.

## What is it?

A simple dump for your email signups.

## I'm a programmer. Talk nerdy to me.

It's a simple Flask application using Gevent that persists signups in a
MongoDB database. It's meant to be hosted on Heroku with the MongoLab
add-on.

## How do I use it?

1. `git clone https://github.com/dskang/email-bin.git`
2. `heroku create`
3. `heroku addons:add mongolab:starter`
4. `git push heroku master`
5. Once you have the server working, you can simply create a form with a
   text field and submit button anywhere* and set the 'action' attribute
   to HEROKU-APP-URL/signup. Look inside the example directory for help.

*Email Bin allows cross domain requests, so Email Bin does not need to
reside on the same domain as your actual site.

## I want to develop locally.

1. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   If you have issues installing gevent, run `brew install libevent`.
2. Run `heroku config | grep MONGOLAB_URI` and copy the MONGOLAB_URI
   into a new file named .env, using sample.env as a guide.
3. `foreman start`
